      <h3>What is NIIT Technologies</h3>
      <p>NIIT technologies is the IT company which is spread across more than 35 countries and not the institute sector.
         Home | NIIT Technologies will give you better insight about how big the company is.
         It is the parent company and NIIT institutes can be said as the subsidiary of the NIIT technologies.
         But it’s quite unfortunate that in our country they did not do much marketing for the IT firm compared to the
        institute sector.
        I have worked in this firm for more than three years and it’s a good place for freshers to start with. 
        Last but not the least, every single time when you say to some one that you’re working NIIT , the very next
        annoying question would be which branch and what are you teaching?t’s technically not normal thing to work in the rotational
         shift for a monotonous kind of repetitive work which makes things a bit boring most of the time and you don’t get to explore 
         into the various aspects due to process that you need to follow. This is all about niit technologies.
        Yes, we all NIITians have faced it at least one point in their lifetime during their tenure with NIIT.</p>

        <h3>Clients of NIIT</h3>
        <p>Left the company 2 years back but it holds a good position in TTL sector.
           Many international airlines, automotive manufacturers and logistics companies are its partners.
            It also works in BFSI, Media and government sector. Not mentioning specific client names but you can find them on
             www.niit-tech.com
             e company is open to suggestions from their employees or people as they call it. They aim at excelling standards of
           customer satisfaction. The office timings are good if one is an early riser. The work environment is decent with some time 
           to time entertainments conducted by HR. It is recommended for freshers if one is keen on learning.
           when I joined in the organisation I was majorly relying on the brand and the reputation it had in the market but at the 
           end u have to focus on the profile you are into and it’s pros and cons. So for a graphic designer the organisation doesn’t 
           have that much of scope in terms of learning some thing new and challenging or the intra or external training which helps you
            to compete with the outside world.

         <h3>How to join NIIT</h3>
         <p>NIIT technology usually conducts 3 rounds to filter out the Candidates for the profile of software engineer. 
           There was on the spot registration process for the drive on the basis of first come first serves. 
           They entertained around 600 people and afterward stopped further registrations.
            Post registration, we gathered for small pre placement talk in Sviet auditorium where NIIT officials explained the job
             profile, role and salary bteakup etc.First round was offline MCQ based paper having aptitude, reasoning, English and 
             few basic technical question which were easy to attempt. One thing I would like to jot down that cut off was much
              higher than I expected, they were selecting only few candidates an All the qualified candidates got message for the 
              second round (technical interview ) which was scheduled next day. Out of 600 candidates only 50 people were called 
              for technical round and last round was HR round which didn't happen.Finally they selected 16 candidates and one 
              group picture was taken of all the selected candidates with college director and company Officials.</p>
